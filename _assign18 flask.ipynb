    "### Q3. What is App routing in Flask? Why do we use app routes?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In Flask, app routing refers to the process of mapping a URL to a specific function in your application. When a user makes a request to your web application, Flask uses the URL provided by the user to determine which function should handle the request.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The @app.route decorator is used to define routes in a Flask application. The decorator takes a URL pattern as an argument, and associates it with a Python function that will be executed when the URL is requested.\n",
    "#### @app.route('/')\n",
    "#### def index():\n",
    "####  return 'Hello, World!'\n",
    "#### We use app routes in Flask to create a well-organized and maintainable web application. By defining routes for different URLs, we can separate the functionality of our web application into different functions, making it easier to manage and update our code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### App routes also allow us to create dynamic web applications, where the content of a web page changes based on user input or other variables. For example, we might create a route that takes a parameter from the user and returns a customized web page based on that parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overall, app routing is a fundamental concept in Flask web development, allowing us to map URLs to specific functions and create dynamic and maintainable web applications."
