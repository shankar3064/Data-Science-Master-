    "\n",
    "#### Consistency: By inheriting from the Exception class, our custom exception will have the same behavior and structure as other built-in exceptions in Python. This makes it easier to use and understand, as it follows the same conventions as other exceptions.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Code readability: By using the Exception class as the base class, we can indicate to other developers who may read our code that our custom exception is, in fact, an exception. This makes the code more readable and easier to understand."

    "### Q6. List down some best practices for exception handling in python.\n",
    "#### Be specific: Catch only the exceptions that you expect and can handle, and avoid catching generic exceptions like Exception or BaseException. This helps to prevent catching unexpected exceptions and to handle them in a more targeted way.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Handle exceptions at the appropriate level: Catch exceptions at the level where you can handle them most effectively. This may mean catching them in a different function or module than where they were raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Use multiple except blocks: Use multiple except blocks to handle different exceptions separately. This makes the code easier to read and understand, and allows you to handle different types of exceptions in different ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Provide informative error messages: Use informative error messages that explain what went wrong and provide guidance on how to fix the issue. This can help users to resolve the problem quickly and efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Use finally for cleanup: Use finally to perform cleanup operations, such as closing files or releasing resources, regardless of whether an exception was raised or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Avoid bare except: Avoid using bare except statements, which catch all exceptions indiscriminately. This can make it difficult to debug errors and can lead to unexpected behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Use logging: Use the logging module to log error messages and debug information. This can help you to diagnose and fix issues more easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Don't ignore exceptions: Don't ignore exceptions or suppress them without good reason. This can lead to unexpected behavior and can make it difficult to diagnose and fix issues."
