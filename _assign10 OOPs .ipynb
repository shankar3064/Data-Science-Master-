    "#### 'r' (Read Only): This is the default mode for opening a file. It opens the file in read-only mode, meaning you can only read the file and not write to it.\n",
    "#### 'w' (Write Only): This mode opens the file in write-only mode. If the file exists, it will overwrite the file, if not, it will create a new file.\n",
    "#### 'a' (Append Only): This mode opens the file in append mode. It appends new data to the end of the file, leaving the existing data intact. If the file does not exist, it will create a new file.\n",
    "#### 'x' (Exclusive Creation): This mode opens the file for exclusive creation. If the file exists, it will raise an error, if not, it will create a new file.\n",
    "#### 'b' (Binary): This mode opens the file in binary mode, which is used for reading and writing binary files like images, audio, and video files.\n",
    "#### '+' (Read and Write): This mode opens the file for reading and writing."
