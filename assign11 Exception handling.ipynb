    "### Q1.what is an exception handling in python? write the difference between exception and syntax errors\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ANS:-  In Python, an exception is a runtime error that occurs when something unexpected happens during the execution of a program. Python provides a built-in mechanism called \"exception handling\" to handle such errors and prevent them from causing the program to crash.When an exception occurs, Python generates an error message and stops the program from executing further. With exception handling, you can catch these errors and take appropriate actions, such as logging the error, displaying a message to the user, or retrying the operation.\n",
    "#### The main difference between syntax errors and exceptions is that syntax errors are caught by the interpreter during the compilation stage, while exceptions are caught by the program during runtime. Syntax errors are usually caused by incorrect syntax or typographical errors, while exceptions are caused by unexpected conditions or events that occur during the execution of the program."
