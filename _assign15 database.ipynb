    "### Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "#### A database is a structured collection of data that can be accessed, managed, and updated. It is used to store information, such as customer information, sales transactions, inventory data, and more. Databases can be broadly classified into two categories: SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### SQL databases, also known as relational databases, store data in tables that are related to each other through defined relationships. They use the SQL (Structured Query Language) to manipulate and retrieve data. SQL databases have a fixed schema, which means that the structure of the data is defined in advance, and any changes to the schema require careful planning and execution. Some popular SQL databases include MySQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### NoSQL databases, on the other hand, store data in non-tabular or non-relational structures, such as documents, key-value pairs, or graphs. They do not use the SQL language for querying and instead use APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) or other query languages. NoSQL databases are designed to be highly scalable and flexible, making them suitable for handling large volumes of unstructured data. They do not have a fixed schema, which means that data can be added or removed without requiring any schema modifications. Some popular NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, and Couchbase."

    "### Q5. Explain Primary Key and Foreign Key.\n",
    "#### Primary key and foreign key are important concepts in relational databases. They are used to define relationships between tables and ensure the integrity of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A primary key is a unique identifier for a record in a table. It is a column or set of columns that uniquely identify each row in the table. A primary key must have a unique value for each row, and it cannot be null. Typically, the primary key is defined when the table is created, and it is used to establish relationships with other tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### For example, in a \"customers\" table, the customer ID might be the primary key. This means that each row in the table has a unique customer ID value, and this value is used to identify and relate to specific customer records in other tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A foreign key is a column or set of columns in a table that refers to the primary key of another table. It is used to establish a relationship between two tables. The foreign key ensures that the data in the table is consistent with the data in the related table. It also ensures that the data in the related table is not deleted or updated if there are related records in the current table.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### For example, in a \"orders\" table, the customer ID might be a foreign key that refers to the primary key in the \"customers\" table. This means that each order in the \"orders\" table is associated with a specific customer in the \"customers\" table. The foreign key ensures that only valid customer IDs can be entered in the \"orders\" table, and it prevents the deletion of customer records that have associated orders."
