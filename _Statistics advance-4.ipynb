The t-test is based on the t-distribution, which is a family of distributions that are similar to the standard normal distribution.

    "here is an explanation of Type 1 and Type 2 errors in hypothesis testing:\n",
    "\n",
    "Type I error: A Type I error occurs when the null hypothesis is rejected when it is actually true. This is also known as a false positive. For example, a Type I error would occur if a researcher concluded that a new drug was effective when it was actually not effective.\n",
    "Type II error: A Type II error occurs when the null hypothesis is not rejected when it is actually false. This is also known as a false negative. For example, a Type II error would occur if a researcher concluded that a new drug was not effective when it actually was effective.\n",
    "Here are some example scenarios for each type of error:\n",
    "\n",
    "Type I error: A researcher is testing a new drug to see if it is effective in reducing pain. The null hypothesis is that the drug is not effective. The researcher sets the significance level at 0.05, which means that there is a 5% chance of making a Type I error. The researcher conducts the study and finds that the mean pain score for the drug group is significantly lower than the mean pain score for the placebo group. The researcher concludes that the drug is effective, but it is actually not effective. This is a Type I error.\n",
    "Type II error: A researcher is testing a new teaching method to see if it is more effective than the traditional method in improving student test scores. The null hypothesis is that the new method is not more effective. The researcher sets the significance level at 0.05, which means that there is a 5% chance of making a Type II error. The researcher conducts the study and finds that the mean test scores for the new method group are not significantly different from the mean test scores for the traditional method group. The researcher concludes that the new method is not more effective, but it actually is more effective. This is a Type II error.\n",
    "It is important to note that Type I and Type II errors are inevitable in hypothesis testing. The only way to avoid making either error is to set the significance level to 0, which means that there is no chance of making a Type I error, but there is also no chance of making a Type II error. However, this would mean that we would never reject the null hypothesis, even if it was actually false.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to minimize the risk of making a Type I or Type II error is to increase the sample size. A larger sample size will make it more likely that the results of the study will be statistically significant, which will reduce the risk of making a Type II error. However, a larger sample size will also increase the risk of making a Type I error.\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision of whether to accept or reject the null hypothesis is a trade-off between the risk of making a Type I error and the risk of making a Type II error. The researcher must decide which error is more serious and then set the significance level accordingly."

    "We are 95% confident that the true proportion of people who are satisfied with their job lies within the range of approximately 60.82% to 69.18%. This means that if we were to take multiple samples and construct a confidence interval for each sample, we would expect that 95% of these intervals would contain the true proportion, and only 5% would not. Therefore, based on the sample data and assuming a 95% confidence level, we can reasonably estimate that the proportion of people satisfied with their job is likely to fall within this interval."
